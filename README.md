## DEPRECATED: with-feature

This was an experiment to see if some of the features I liked in
[`use-package`][use-package] could be replicated in a better way. Soon
after I started this project, John Wiegley did some amazing work on
`use-package` which fixed virtually every outstanding problem, and as
a result this project is now deprecated as I aim to get all of my
desired changes merged upstream.
